*4 principles*  
WCAG is organized around four principles often called by the acronym POUR:  

- Perceivable: Can users perceive the content? This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense, such as sight, that doesn’t mean that all users can perceive it.

- Operable: Can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can’t use a mouse or touch screen.

- Understandable: Can users understand the content? Can users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?

- Robust: Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents (browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?  

*Accessibility Levels*  
After defining the 4 principles, WCAG defined 3 differents levels, the two first being absolutely required for any business and website. AAA level is recommended but not required as it may have bigger impacts on designs.  

*Levels*  
- Level A (required)
A: This level improves accessibility for most sites by making it easier for browsing readers to navigate a site and translate its content, but it is still pretty basic.

- Level AA (required)
AA: This level makes content accessible to people with a wider range of disabilities by providing guidance on elements such as color contrast and error identification. Regulators prefer this level.

- Level AAA (optional)
AAA: The highest level of accessibility compliance, this makes content accessible to the widest range of people, but it can significantly alter the design of a site. Government legislation doesn’t typically require this because it’s not always possible to conform.
